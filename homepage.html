    <h1>The HBO-ICT Course</h1>
    <h2>Why the HBO level suits me?</h2>

    <p>I believe the HBO level is perfect for me because, I am not always a fast and advance learner.
        Although often times I understand what needs to be done for all lectures, I still take more time than others.
        In addition, I think that the system is very clear and managable for me, and I intend to get my Properdeuse
        after the first year!</p>

    <h2>Why the study programme suits my personality?</h2>

    <p>HBO-ICT suits my personality because I often like to hide behind the computer, I find it amazing how much you can
        do with it throughout the day,
        such as having it for entertainment or for work and studies. I enjoy sitting at my desk being able to manage
        things from home, when possible.
        Lasty, I find it fascinating what you can do with programming. Personaly, I want to go in the direction of game
        development, since I am a gamer
        and many of my friends share the same interests as me</p>
