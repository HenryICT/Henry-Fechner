<h2>Why the HBO level suits me?</h2>

<p>I believe the HBO level is perfect for me because, I am not always a fast and advance learner.
    Although often times I understand what needs to be done for all lectures, I still take more time than others.
    In addition, I think that the system is very clear and managable for me, and I intend to get my Properdeuse after the first year!</p>

<h2>Why the study programme suits my personality?</h2>

<p>HBO-ICT suits my personality because I often like to hide behind the computer, I find it amazing how much you can do with it throughout the day, 
    such as having it for entertainment or for work and studies. I enjoy sitting at my desk being able to manage things from home, when possible. 
    Lasty, I find it fascinating what you can do with programming. Personaly, I want to go in the direction of game development, since I am a gamer 
    and many of my friends share the same interests as me</p>
